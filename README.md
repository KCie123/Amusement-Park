# Amusement Park Scene

This WebGL-based project renders a 3D amusement park scene, complete with a rotating merry-go-round, textured horses, and various other scene elements. The textures are applied to different objects using WebGL shaders and texture mapping.

## Project Description
The amusement park scene includes a carousel with horses, pillars, and a rotating top/bottom structure. The scene also features camera controls that allow users to move and rotate the camera for a dynamic view of the scene. The project implements texture mapping to give the scene a realistic feel by using different textures such as wood, zebra stripes, plastic, and bricks.

### Key Features:
- **Merry-Go-Round:** A rotating carousel with horses and structural components.
- **Texture Mapping:** Textures applied to the horses, floor, and other components using WebGL shaders.
- **Camera Controls:** Allows users to move the camera around the scene using keyboard controls for a dynamic view.
- **Scene Elements:** Includes detailed components like horses, pillars, floor, and top/bottom cubes of the carousel.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML5:** Structure of the WebGL canvas and UI.
- **WebGL:** Used for 3D rendering, lighting, and texture mapping.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** Handles rendering logic, input handling, and WebGL interaction.
- **Textures:** Different image textures such as bricks, wood, zebra patterns, and plastic are mapped onto objects.
